# Lapi

An API framework for Deno.

**NOTE:** This project is a heavy WIP, therefore this may not be up to date.

## Why

I started this project because I wanted a very easy to use framework to build APIs with in Deno. There are definitely some great ones that have already been created but they always seem to be very loose on implementation details which can lead to hard to read code. The goal of this framework is to be very easy to use, to be very extensible, and to have a consistent architecture.
